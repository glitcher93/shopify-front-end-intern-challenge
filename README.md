# Shopify Front-End Challenge

Welcome to my submission for the Shopify Front-End Intern Challenge!

## Features

The user is able to enter a prompt and produce an AI generated response via OpenAI's API. The user can also choose from 4 different engines from OpenAI's GPT-3 model. Example presets are provided for the user to see some responses from an example prompt. The application also persists the responses to the browser's local storage.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Redux
- Axios
- SASS
- TypeScript
- Vite

## Moving Forward

In the future, I would possibly like to make this AI generator for a specific purpose. I may also like to create a back end to persist responses and possibly implement user authentication.
